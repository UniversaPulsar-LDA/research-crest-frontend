        description: "In smart cities, AI‐driven traffic flow prediction and anomaly detection play a crucial role in optimizing urban mobility and reducing congestion. Traditional traffic management systems (TMS) often struggle with real‐time adaptability, leading to inefficiencies in traffic prediction and failure to detect anomalies accurately. To address these limitations, we propose the Traffic Flow Prediction using Multi‐Agent Approach (TFP‐MAA) framework, which leverages multiple intelligent agents to analyze real‐time traffic data, predict congestion patterns, and detect anomalies with high precision. The framework integrates deep learning models with a decentralized multi‐agent system to enhance prediction accuracy and response efficiency. The proposed method enables adaptive decision‐making for traffic authorities by providing real‐time congestion forecasts and identifying unusual traffic patterns, such as accidents or roadblocks. This enhances proactive traffic management and reduces delays. Experimental results demonstrate that TFP‐MAA significantly outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy (94.7%), response time (96.2%), and anomaly detection efficiency (95.9%). The findings suggest that integrating multi‐agent AI systems into smart city infrastructure can lead to improved traffic flow (97.5%), reduced congestion (28.6%), and enhanced road safety.",
